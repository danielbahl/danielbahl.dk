Hi! My name is Daniel Bahl.

I'm a nerd and entrepreneur currently focused on e-learning, cloud and automated intelligent platforms. I’m a skilled developer with focus on backend-code, automation, AI, Cloud and security.

I'm also a noisy Linux and Apple fanatic, dad to my two children Magnus and Tilde,  husband to my beautiful wife Rikke, house owner in Silkeborg, Denmark, photographer, video podcaster and a Weber Grill Guru. Oh. And a yellow car-owner. ;) To sum everything up, I’m a friendly geek who has been writing code for more than twenty years and still going strong :)

I'm a patient perfectionist with a focus on simple minimalistic design, both in terms of code as well as UIs. I love to solve complex problems in an ingenious and creative way - and I love to take on time-consuming workflows with automation, APIs and AI.
* I'm the man behind Denmark's maybe largest e-learning platform, v5.dk.
* I'm the man behind several popular FiveStars iOS apps in the App Store, including Next/Næste and GemID
* I'm the man behind a whole host of popular projects, such as: strøm.dk, appzoo.dk, servicepoint.dk, cloudnet.dk, v5.dk, cloudportal.dk and cloudbloggen.dk. [Link to my projects]
* I've had my fingers deep inside some awesome companies like Zitcom, Telmore and Wupti, crafting awesome revolutionary stuff. 

I've been living in a world of hosting and data centers until 2013 when I sold my company ServerHosting A/S to Zitcom. With this, I said goodbye to being a stressed solo-guy running more than 600+ servers, a large Cloud-infrastructure, Cisco routers and firewalls and all the code behind our awesome self-service panel and automation. One guy. 600+ servers. I didn’t get much sleep back then ;)
Now I'm working together with my fantastic team at ServicePoint A/S with a mission to make the power of the Cloud available to everybody :) Take a look at Cloudportal.dk and my other websites. ServicePoint is located in Katrinebjerg in Aarhus together with, among others, Google Denmark, Xamarin, Microsoft, Plex, Cure4you, B&O and VMware.
Besides playing with the power of the Cloud at ServicePoint, I’m also working on a exciting project called octodesk. octodesk is a unified platform as a service, providing a complete interface for companies to manage customers, support, projects, billing and documentation. octodesk is currently running in a private beta powering multiple companies and more than 4.000+ customers.
Oh. I almost forgot Betty. Betty is the AI I’m working on. Betty is a self-developed AI bot built upon some awesome AI frameworks, and right now Betty is installed at my home helping us controlling lights, doors, alarm-system, camera, audio-system, floor heating and much more. Betty is also crafting a weekly meal-plan based on our likes and dislikes and keeps us updated on the weather and calendar events for the day. Oh. And Betty never forgets to turn off the lights and arm the alarm when the last person leaves the house ;)
If you are interested in something. Please feel free to tweet me @danielbahl or e-mail me at hello at danielbahl.com.
My website danielbahl.com / danielbahl.dk is mainly a hub of links to my other projects around the web.
Thanks for listening!

*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Chief among the novel's supporting cast is a man by the name of Mr. Poole, Dr. Jekyll's loyal butler.

-----

Poole is the butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

There are currently three themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
* [Enfield](http://enfield.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).

### What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml), posts, and [example page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

### Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

These themes are developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
