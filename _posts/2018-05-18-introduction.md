### Hi! It's me 👋

I'm a nerd and entrepreneur currently focused on **e-learning, cloud** and **automated intelligent platforms**. I’m a skilled developer with focus on backend-code, automation, AI, Cloud and security.

I'm also a **noisy Linux and Apple fanatic**, **dad** to my two lovely children Magnus and Tilde,  **husband** to my **beautiful wife** Rikke, **house owner** in Silkeborg, Denmark, **photographer**, video **podcaster** and a Weber **Grill Guru**. Oh. And a yellow car-owner. 🚕 ;) To sum everything up, I’m a **friendly geek** who has been writing code for more than twenty years and still going strong :)

I'm a **patient perfectionist** with a focus on simple minimalistic design, both in terms of code as well as UIs. I love to **solve complex problems** in an **ingenious** and **creative way** - and I love to take on time-consuming workflows with automation, APIs and AI.
* I'm the man behind Denmark's maybe largest **e-learning platform**, v5.dk.
* I'm the man behind several popular **Five-stars iOS apps** in the App Store, including Next/Næste and GemID
* I'm the man behind a whole host of **popular projects**, such as: strøm.dk, appzoo.dk, servicepoint.dk, cloudnet.dk, v5.dk, cloudportal.dk and cloudbloggen.dk. [Link to my projects]
* I've had my fingers deep inside some **awesome companies** like Zitcom, Telmore and Wupti, crafting awesome revolutionary stuff. 

### Before 🦖

I've been **living in a world of hosting and data centers until 2013** when I sold my company ServerHosting A/S to Zitcom. With this, I said goodbye to being a stressed solo-guy running more than 600+ servers, a large Cloud-infrastructure, Cisco routers and firewalls and all the code behind our awesome self-service panel and automation. One guy. 600+ servers. I didn’t get much sleep back then ;)

### Now 🎉

Now I'm working together with my **fantastic team at ServicePoint A/S** with a mission to make the power of the **Cloud available to everybody** :) Take a look at Cloudportal.dk and my other websites. ServicePoint is located in Katrinebjerg in Aarhus together with, among others, Google Denmark, Xamarin, Microsoft, Plex, Cure4you, B&O and VMware.

### octodesk 🐙

Besides playing with the power of the Cloud at ServicePoint, I’m also working on a exciting project called **octodesk**. octodesk is a **unified platform** as a service, providing a complete interface for companies to manage **customers, support, projects, billing and documentation**. octodesk is currently running in a private beta powering multiple companies and more than 4.000+ customers.

### Betty 💁

Oh. I almost forgot **Be*tty***. Betty is the **AI** I’m working on. Betty is a **self-developed AI bot** built upon some awesome AI and ML frameworks, and right now Betty is **installed at my home** helping my family and I **controlling smart-home stuff** like lights, doors, alarm-system, camera, audio-system, floor heating and much more. Betty is also crafting a **weekly meal-plan** based on our likes and dislikes and keeps us updated on the **weather** and **calendar events** for the day. Oh. And Betty **never forgets** to **turn off the lights** and arm the alarm **when the last person leaves the house** ;)
